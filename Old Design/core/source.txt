		end the story saying “[bold type]All of the sudden, your vision quickly fades to black. You awake to find yourself laying down on a cushioned surface and suddenly feel a virtual reality helmet being pulled off your head. The bright lights blind you for a second, as your eyes adjust you make out a few men and women encircling the bed you are laying on. They are all wearing various military uniforms, you notice most of them are generals or other high ranking officers. One of the four star generals stares down at your seriously, 'You ran out of time Cadet. In emergency situations, time is of the essence. Make better use of yours.”;
	if the remainder after dividing the MinutesLeft by 10 is 0:

	now Oxygen is Oxygen - 1;
	[say “DEBUG: Oxygen Remaining: [Oxygen]”;]
	if Oxygen is less than 5:

They are all wearing various military uniforms, you notice most of them are generals or other high ranking officers. One of the four star generals pats you on the shoulder, 'Good attempt Cadet, but you should have heeded the DANGER sign on the door. You almost had it, maybe next time you can find something to protect you from those fumes! This will conclude your Captain's Exam round this year, you will not be advancing. I wish you the best next year.'”;
