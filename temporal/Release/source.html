The glimmer of moon provides just enough light for you to take a look around.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The temporal rift is south of the Castle Keep and north of the Convenience Store. The temporal rift is an open door. “A strange rift floats on the <span class="comment">[if player is in the Castle Keep]</span>south<span class="comment">[else]</span>north<span class="comment">[end if]</span> end of the room, crackling and rippling.”</p><p class="indent0">The description of the temporal rift is &quot;<span class="quote">The strange tear is like nothing you've ever seen before. It might go somewhere , but do you really want to find out?</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The Convenience Store is south of the temporal rift. The Convenience Store is a room. &quot;<span class="quote">The rift spits you out, dropping into what appears to be a convenience store. Judging by the lack of employees and customers, you gather they're likely closed. Only the flourescents from the drink walls light the store.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The arch window is west of the Castle Keep. The arch window is an open door. &quot;<span class="quote">An arch-shaped window to the west peers out from the tower.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The description of the arch window is &quot;<span class="quote">Upon closer inspection, you spot the end of a braid of hair, caught up in an iron bar jutting out from below the window. As your eyes follow the braid down, they become lost in the darkness... Better not fall.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The Falling is a room. The Falling is west of the arch window. </p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[Convenience Store Objects]</span></p><p class="indent0">A burrito is in the Convenience Store. The burrito is either flaming or frozen. The description is “A<span class="comment">[if frozen]</span>n ice cold<span class="comment">[else]</span> scorching hot<span class="comment">[end if]</span>, dense bean brick. Could be useful if you needed to smash something? Ha.”</p><p class="indent0">An energy drink is in the Convenience Store. The description is “Uncle Iro’s Jumpstarter Fluid: 62 times the caffeine found in coffee! ...Yuck.”</p><p class="indent0">The microwave is fixed in place in the Convenience Store. The microwave is either juiced or broken. It is an open transparent container. “There is a rusty microwave behind the empty counter.”</p><p class="indent0">The description of the microwave is “Thoroughly banged up, the piece of shit barely displays an incorrect time, as the light inside flickers. Looks like the thing isn’t getting enough juice. Oh, and why there's a funnel sticking out of this behemoth is beyond you.”</p><p class="indent0">The bucket is an object. The knight's helmet is wearable. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Sitting atop your head in place of the valiant helmet is a yellow bucket, quite the contrary...</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[Castle Keep Objects]</span></p><p class="indent0">A steel chest is a closed unopenable container in the Castle Keep. A knight’s helmet is in the steel chest.

What happened to the burrito??[</span><span class="substitution">else</span><span class="quote">]The blade of the mysterious sword you've stumbled upon is scorching hot, dangerous to the touch.
