======ENDING 1: SAVE THE SHIP=====

Core Decisions
An Interactive Fiction by Sean Mendenhall and Hayden Platt
Release 1 / Serial number 150608 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Sleeping Quarters
Four bland grey walls surround you, periodically glowing red with the siren's light. The mess hall is east of here.

You can see a holoscreen here.

>e

Mess Hall
As you enter, you're quickly trapped in the flow of people heading for escape pods in the engineering bay. Half-eaten meal trays scatter the hall. To the south is the bridge and to the west is the sleeping quarters.

You can see a gas mask here.

Your watch tech beeps loudly, and displays a message: ***WARNING: 60 minutes remain. Please evacuate immediately.***

"Looks like I should be able to keep track of how much time I have left with this. I'd better hurry!"

>take gas mask
Taken.

>wear gas mask
You put on the gas mask.

>s

Bridge
The central hub of the ship, you notice almost everyone is rushing hand over foot towards the Engineering Bay. The Captain's Quarters are to the west, the Hanger is to the east, Engineering Bay is to the south, and the Mess Hall is north.

You can see the Captain directing people towards the escape pods whilst standing atop one of the control panels.

You can also see a Captain's Door here.

>s

Engineering Bay
As you enter the engineering bay escape pods blast off on either side, a wave of people swarm the few remaining escape pods and they begin filling quickly. To the west is the Reactor Room, to the north is the Bridge.

To the west is a thick iron door leading to the ship's reactor. A sign on it reads DANGER: TOXIC FUMES Looks like it's hooked up to the access panel in the room.

You can also see a crowbar, an escape pod (in which is an eject button) and an access panel (empty) here.

>take crowbar
Taken.

Bridge
The central hub of the ship, you notice almost everyone is rushing hand over foot towards the Engineering Bay. The Captain's Quarters are to the west, the Hanger is to the east, Engineering Bay is to the south, and the Mess Hall is north.

You can see the Captain directing people towards the escape pods whilst standing atop one of the control panels.

You can also see a Captain's Door here.

>pry door
You stick the crowbar into the crack in the door, and use some good ol" mechanical advantage to pry it open just enough for you to fit through!

Captain's Quarters
Much bigger than your quarters. Guess that's one of the perks of being the Captain. The Bridge is to the west.

A mess of clothes scatters the room.

You spot a keycard lying on the corner of the desk.

You can also see a Captain's Door here.

>take keycard
Taken.

Hangar
Ohhhh planes!! To the east is the Bridge.

You can see a scout ship, a transport ship, an attack ship, a window and an engine cover (closed) here.

Your watch tech beeps loudly, and displays a message: ***WARNING: 50 minutes remain. Please evacuate immediately.***
>pry cover
You pry open the attack ship's engine cover, revealing a fusion reactor core. It's obviously less powerful than the broken one, but maybe it will tide us over for a landing?

>take core
Taken.

>insert keycard into panel
You slip the card into the machine. It lights up green as the reactor door opens!

>w
(first opening the Reactor Door)

You make your way into the fog of toxins. Luckily, your gas mask protects you from the fumes.

THUD!
The reactor door violently slams shut behind you. It looks as if its electronics failed, you're trapped. If you can't replace the core quickly, it's all over.
Quick, before you die!
>look
Reactor Room
Quick, before you die!

To the west is a thick iron door leading to the ship's reactor. A sign on it reads DANGER: TOXIC FUMES Looks like it's hooked up to the access panel in the room.

You can also see a fusion chamber (in which is an overheated core) here.

>take overheated core
Taken.

>insert fusion into chamber
(the fusion reactor core into the fusion chamber)
You replace the overheated fusion core with the new one!
You did it, the ship is saved! Fortunately, the Captain was able to get the door back open for you, and you emerge to a crowd of cheers coming from those whose lives you just saved!



    *** All of the sudden, your vision quickly fades to black. You awake to find yourself laying down on a cushioned surface and suddenly feel a virtual reality helmet being pulled off your head. The bright lights blind you for a second, as your eyes adjust you make out a few men and women encircling the bed you are laying on. They are all wearing various military uniforms, you notice most of them are generals or other high ranking officers. One of the four star generals places a hand on your shoulder and gives it a gentle squeeze as he smiles down at you, "Great job Cadet, you handled that emergency simulation like a true Captain! You'll be advancing to the next phase of the exam." ***

You get into the escape pod.

In the escape pod you can see an eject button.

>activate eject button
You strap yourself into the escape pod, stare down and press the eject button. With a sudden burst you blast away from the ship. As you look back you spot the panicked faces of your comrades you just left to die.

Those virtual lives were dependent on you repairing the ship, but you chose the easy way out! In my report I will have to recommend you be reprimanded for your actions during this simulation. You will be going no further in this year's Captain's Exam." ***

You raise your XS-10 Laser Pistol, steady your breath, aim, and fire. A red laser beam streaks across the room and strikes the captain in her back. The captain falls to the floor amid the mass of people screaming and thrashing to get away from the blood. As they form a circle around her body you take her spot atop the crate and they're gaze shifts upward, "I am the captain now!"

Cadet, I am going have to recommend you be released from the Academy and be processed for a psychiatric evaluation." ***

======ENDING 4: TOTAL FAILURE=============

Wait 60 turns until your watch timer reaches zero and the ship implodes.
